Next Steps:
- Add user management
	- Add an admin user / pass (no public registration)
	- Add a user management page (add / view / edit / delete)
- Add project management
- Add ticket management (under projects)
	- Time estimates for tickets (static upon creation)
	- Keep track of which ticket is being worked on (all operation happen through git)
	- Calculate code speeds of users upon ticket completion
- Find a way to get ssh auth working with git
	- Add a linux user with same name as user in db
	- Restrict ssh for that user to being in /priv/users/<username>, and restrict to git-shell (only git ops)
	- Have all git repos hosted be under /priv/projects/<project_id>
	- Add symlinks like /priv/users/<username>/projects/<project_id> -> /priv/projects/<project_id> if user has access to that project
