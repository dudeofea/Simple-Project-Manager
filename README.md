# A Ticket System

Just a ticket system

## Progress

-10%. How is that possible: I'm currently almost done writing the page router so I can actually start my project. Why would I do such a thing? I just couldn't use any other page routing / JS framework as I didn't like the way it worked and what it involved. Vue.js was the best contender but they lost me at communication between views. So I said screw it and now I'm using server side templates, but with a simple routing solution. Good news is I plan on also using this for Tent, the next elixir project which this is leading up to.
